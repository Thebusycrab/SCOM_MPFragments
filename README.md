# SCOM_MPFragments

There are some cool MP fragments written by Kavin Holman,
when I first used the VSA Extention, it was fun to learn from thease fragments.

This reporsitory is for MP fragments that I have written during my authoring assignments.

Thease are strictly on AS IS basis, I am not responsible for any issues.
